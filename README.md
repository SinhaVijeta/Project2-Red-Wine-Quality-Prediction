# Project2-Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction
The dataset is related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

This dataset can be viewed as classification task. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.
